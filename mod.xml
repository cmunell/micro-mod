Example context.xml for the Microreading on Demand servlet (JSON15Servelet.java in
the micro-mod subdirectory)

This goes into Tomcat's directory like /etc/tomcat6/Catalina/localhost/ and
then Tomcat will go find the WAR file you built by looking at the docBase
value below.  Whenever you rebuild, Tomcat will detect the change to the WAR
file and reload it.  Pretty convenient, and administrative privliges are only
needed to copy this XML file into Tomcat's configuration directory.

<Context docBase="/home/bkisiel/rtw/micro-mod/target/micro-mod.war" reloadable="true">

</Context>
